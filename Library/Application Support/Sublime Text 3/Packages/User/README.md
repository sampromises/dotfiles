# Sublime-Text-3

A back-up repository for my Sublime Text 3 packages and package settings.

From [https://packagecontrol.io/docs/syncing](https://packagecontrol.io/docs/syncing):

> The proper solution is to install Package Control on all machines and then to sync only the Packages/User/ folder. This folder contains the Package Control.sublime-settings file, which includes a list of all installed packages. If this file is copied to another machine, the next time Sublime Text is started, Package Control will install the correct version of any missing packages.
